## Application Architecture Documentation

### Overview

This Android application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern, leveraging the advantages of Jetpack Compose for building the UI (User Interface) and Kotlin for the core logic. The architecture is designed to promote a clear separation of concerns, enhance testability, and improve maintainability.

### Components

1. **Model:** 
   - Represents the data and business logic of the application.
   - Includes classes like `FileRepository` which interact with the file system to retrieve file information.

2. **View:** 
   - Consists of UI components built using Jetpack Compose.
   - Includes composable functions like `FileExplorerScreen` and `FileItemView` to display file information.

3. **ViewModel:** 
   - Serves as the intermediary between the Model and View.
   - Contains `FileExplorerViewModel` which holds the state and logic for the file explorer UI.
   - Responsible for calling Model methods and preparing data for display.

### Key Classes and Functions

- `FileExplorerViewModel`:
  - Type: ViewModel
  - Description: Manages UI-related data for the file explorer screen and survives configuration changes.
  - Functions: 
    - `loadFiles(directoryPath: String)`: Loads files from the specified directory path.

- `FileExplorerScreen`:
  - Type: Composable Function
  - Description: Renders the UI for the file explorer.
  - ViewModel: Uses `FileExplorerViewModel` for its data.

- `FileItemView`:
  - Type: Composable Function
  - Description: Renders a single file item in the file explorer.

- `FileRepository`:
  - Type: Model
  - Description: Handles data operations like reading files from a directory.
  - Functions:
    - `getFilesInDirectory(directoryPath: String)`: Returns a list of `FileItem` from the specified directory.

### Testing

- ViewModel and Model classes are tested using JUnit.
- UI components (Composables) are tested using the Jetpack Compose testing framework.

### Dependency Injection (If Applicable)

- Explain how dependencies (like `FileRepository`) are provided to `ViewModels` and other classes.

### Additional Considerations

- **Threading:** Describe any specific threading considerations, especially how coroutines are used in `ViewModels`.
- **Error Handling:** Outline the strategy for handling and reporting errors, especially in `ViewModels` and `Repository`.
- **Navigation:** If applicable, describe how navigation is handled in the app.
- **State Management:** Explain how state is managed and observed within `ViewModels` and Composables.

This documentation provides a high-level overview of the architecture. It should be maintained and updated as the application evolves. For more complex applications, consider including diagrams to illustrate the relationships between different components.
